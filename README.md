# Introduction to PlayWright
I'm starting to learn Playwright. It is a promising test automation tool.
The great thing is that you can use many programming languages to use PlayWright. 
The languages supported by the Playwright are given below:
1. JavaScript
2. Java
3. C#
4. Python
 PlayWright also provides excellent tools for debugging tests in real-time. You can also produce test run recordings and logs with detailed screenshots.
Other than UI testing, you can also test APIs with Playwright.
